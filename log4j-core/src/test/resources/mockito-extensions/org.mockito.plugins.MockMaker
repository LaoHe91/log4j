#
# This alternative mock maker which uses a combination of both Java instrumentation API
# and sub-classing rather than creating a new class to represent a mock. This way, it becomes
# possible to mock final types and methods.
#
# This mock maker is turned off by default because it is based on completely different
# mocking mechanism that requires more feedback from the community. It can be activated
# explicitly by the mockito extension mechanism, just create in the classpath a file
# /mockito-extensions/org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker containing the value mock-maker-inline.
#
# As a convenience, the Mockito team provides an artifact where this mock maker is
# preconfigured. Instead of using the mockito-core artifact, include the mockito-inline
# artifact in your project. Note that this artifact is likely to be discontinued once
# mocking of final classes and methods gets integrated into the default mock maker.
