[#requirements]
== Requirements

* JDK 17+
* A modern Linux, OSX, or Windows host

[#building]
== Building the sources

You can build and verify the sources as follows:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw verify
----

`verify` goal runs validation and test steps next to building (i.e., compiling) the sources.
To speed up the build, you can skip verification:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw -DskipTests package
----

If you want to install generated artifacts to your local Maven repository, replace above `verify` and/or `package` goals with `install`.

[#dns]
=== DNS lookups in tests

Note that if your `/etc/hosts` file does not include an entry for your computer's hostname, then many unit tests may execute slow due to DNS lookups to translate your hostname to an IP address in `InetAddress.getLocalHost()`.
To remedy this, you can execute the following:

[source,bash]
----
printf '127.0.0.1 %s\n::1 %s\n' `hostname` `hostname` | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
----

[#website]
== Building the website and manual

You can build the website and manual as follows:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw site
----

You can view the generated website with a browser by pointing it to `target/site` directory.

[#development]
== Development

You can follow below steps for casual development needs:

. Make sure you installed everything: `./mvnw install -DskipTests`
. After making a change to, say, `log4j-core`, install your changes: `./mvnw install -pl :log4j-core -DskipTests`
. Run all tests associated with `log4j-core`: `./mvnw test -pl :log4j-core-test`
. Run a particular test: `./mvnw test -pl :log4j-core-test -Dtest=FooBarTest`

You can connect your IDE to a `./mvnw test` run by

. Add `-Dmaven.surefire.debug` to the `./mvnw test` command
. Use _"Run > Attach to process"_ in IntelliJ IDEA

[#development-faq]
=== F.A.Q

[#development-faq-idea-plugin-not-found]
==== Compilation in IntelliJ IDEA fails with `java: plug-in not found: ErrorProne`

Try removing all _"Override compiler parameters per-module"_ entries in _"Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler"_.

[#development-faq-idea-package-plugins]
==== Compilation in IntelliJ IDEA fails with `java: package org.apache.logging.log4j.plugins.test.validation.plugins does not exist`

We don't know how to fix this.
