= 2.7 (2016-10-02)

This release contains several bugfixes and new features.
The new features include new logging API modules for Scala 2.10 and 2.11, and support for various non-blocking queue implementations in `AsyncAppender`.
Furthermore the `ThreadContext` map can now be configured to be garbage-free, and users can now inject context data from other sources than `ThreadContext`.
Context data values can be any `Object`, not just ``String``s.
More details on the fixes are itemized below.

Note that subsequent to the 2.6 release a minor source incompatibility was found due to the addition of new methods to the `Logger` interface.
If you have code that does:

[source,java]
----
logger.error(null, “This is the log message”, throwable);
----

or similar with any log level you will get a compiler error saying the reference is ambiguous.
To correct this either do:

[source,java]
----
logger.error(“This is the log message”, throwable);
----

or

[source,java]
----
logger.error((Marker) null, “This is the log message”, throwable);
----

The Log4j 2.7 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Log4j 2.7 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
