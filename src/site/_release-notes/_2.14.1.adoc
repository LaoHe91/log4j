= 2.14.1 (2021-03-06)

This release contains a number of bug fixes and minor enhancements which are
listed below.

Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
`log4j-slf4j-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and `log4j-slf4j18-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and later.

The Log4j 2.14.1 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Log4j 2.14.1 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run.
Log4j 2.12.1 is the last release to support Java 7.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
