= 2.17.0 (2021-12-17)

The major changes contained in this release include:

* Address CVE-2021-45105 by disabling recursive evaluation of Lookups during log event processing.
Recursive evaluation is still allowed while generating the configuration.
* The `JndiLookup`, `JndiContextSelector`, and `JMSAppender` now require individual system properties to be enabled.
* Remove LDAP and LDAPS as supported protocols from JNDI.

The single `log4j2.enableJndi` property introduced in Log4j 2.16.0 has been replaced with three individual properties; `log4j2.enableJndiContextSelector`, `log4j2.enableJndiJms`, and `log4j2.enableJndiLookup`.

The Log4j 2.17.0 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Apache Log4j 2.17.0 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run.
Log4j 2.12.2 is the last release to support Java 7.
Java 7 is no longer supported by the Log4j team.

== Changes

=== Fixed

* Fix string substitution recursion. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3230[LOG4J2-3230] by Carter Kozak)
* Log4j 1.2 bridge API hard codes the Syslog protocol to TCP. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3237[LOG4J2-3237] by Gary Gregory)
* Do not declare log4j-api-java9 and log4j-core-java9 as dependencies as it causes problems with the Maven enforcer plugin. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3241[LOG4J2-3241] by Ralph Goers)
* Limit JNDI to the java protocol only. JNDI will remain disabled by default. Rename JNDI enablement property from 'log4j2.enableJndi' to 'log4j2.enableJndiLookup', 'log4j2.enableJndiJms', and 'log4j2.enableJndiContextSelector'. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3242[LOG4J2-3242] by Ralph Goers)
* PropertiesConfiguration.parseAppenderFilters NPE when parsing properties file filters. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3247[LOG4J2-3247] by Gary Gregory)
* Log4j 1.2 bridge for Syslog Appender defaults to port 512 instead of 514. (for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3249[LOG4J2-3249] by Gary Gregory)
