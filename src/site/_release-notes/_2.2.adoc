= 2.2 (2015-02-22)

This is the fifth GA release.
It contains several bugfixes and new features.

Apache Log4j 2.2 requires a minimum of Java 6 to build and run.
Future releases may require a minimum of Java 7.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
