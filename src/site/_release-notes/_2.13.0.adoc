= 2.13.0 (2019-12-11)

This release contains bugfixes and minor enhancements.
Some of the new features in this release are:

* Log4j 2 now requires Java 8 or higher to build and run.
* Experimental support for Log4j 1 configuration files.
See Log4j 2 Compatiblity with Log4j 1.
* The Logger API has been enhanced to support a builder pattern.
This can dramatically improve the overhead of capturing location information.
See Log Builder.
* Better integration with Spring Boot by providing access to Spring variables in Log4j 2 configuration files and allowing Log4j 2 system properties to be defined in the Spring configuration.
See Logging in the Cloud.
* Support for accessing Kubernetes information via a Log4j 2 Lookup.
* The Gelf Layout now allows the message to be formatted using a `PatternLayout` pattern.
Logging in the Cloud provides an example of this, as well as the use of the Spring and Kubernetes Lookups.

Due to a break in compatibility in the SLF4J binding, Log4j now ships with two versions of the SLF4J to Log4j adapters.
`log4j-slf4j-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.7.x and earlier and `log4j-slf4j18-impl` should be used with SLF4J 1.8.x and later.

Note that the XML, JSON and YAML formats changed in the 2.11.0 release: they no longer have the `timeMillis` attribute and instead have an `Instant` element with `epochSecond` and `nanoOfSecond` attributes.

The Log4j 2.13.0 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Log4j 2.13.0 requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6 and Log4j 2.11.2 is the last release to support Java 7.
