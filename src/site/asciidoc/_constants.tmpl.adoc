    THIS FILE IS USED AS A TEMPLATE TO AUTO-GENERATE `_constants.adoc`!

    The actual `_constants.adoc` that is used in `target/generated-site/asciidoc` is auto-generated from `_constants.tmpl.adoc`.
    Auto-generation happens during `pre-site` phase of Maven.
    Hence, you must always

    1. Edit `_constants.tmpl.adoc`
    2. Fill `_constants.adoc` with dummy values to match the variables in `_constants.tmpl.adoc`
