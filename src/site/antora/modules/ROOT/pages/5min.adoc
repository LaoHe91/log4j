= Log4j explained in 5 minutes

This document aims to guide you through the most important aspects of logging with Log4j.
It is not a comprehensive guide, but it should give you a good starting point.

[#what]
== What is logging?

Logging is the action of publishing diagnostics information at certain points of a program execution. 
It means you can write messages to a log file or console to help you understand what your application is doing.

The simplest way to log in Java is to use `System.out.println()`, like this:

[source, java]
----
private void truncateTable(String tableName) {
  System.out.println("Truncating table"); <1>
  db.truncate(tableName);
}
----
<1> The information that a table is being truncated is written to the console.

This is already useful, but the reader of this message does not know what table is being truncated. 
Usually, we would like to include the table name in the message, which quickly leads
developers to use the `System.out.format` (or similar) methods. 
Log4j helps with formatting strings as we will see later, but for now, let's see how to work without it.

The following code shows how this method could be used to provide more context information.
`%s` will be replaced with the value of `tableName`, and `%n` will be replaced with a new line.

[source, java]
----
private void truncateTable(String tableName) {
    System.out.format("[WARN] Truncating table `%s`%n", tableName); <1>
    db.truncate(tableName);
}
----
<1> `format` writes the message to the console, replacing `%s` with the value of `tableName`.

If the developer decides the truncate the table "fruits", the output of this code will look like this:

[source]
----
[WARN] Truncating table `fruits`
----

This provides observability into an application's runtime and we can follow the execution flow.

However, there are several drawbacks with the above approach and this is where Log4j comes in.
Log4j will help you to write logs in a more structured way, with more information, and with more flexibility.

[#why]
== Why should I use Log4j?

Log4j is a versatile, industrial-grade Java logging framework, maintained by many contributors.
It can help us with common logging tasks and lets us focus on the application logic.

It will: 

* Enhance the message with additional information (timestamp, class & method name, line number, host, severity, etc.)
* Write the message differently, using a different **layout** (CSV, JSON, etc.)
* Write the message to a different medium, using a different **appender** (file, socket, database, queue, etc.)
* Write only some of the messages, using a **filter** (e.g. filter by severity, content, etc.)

[#install]
== Prerequisites

We will need a **BOM** (Bill of Materials) to manage the versions of the dependencies.
In addition, we will need the `log4j-api` dependency itself.

[#architecture]
== Architecture

In a nutshell, Log4j operates with two main parts: the API and the Core.
With this structure, Log4j allows you to log events using the API and route them through the Core.

Optionally you can also route the log events through other logging frameworks 
like SLF4J or JUL (Java Util Logging) by adding a bridge.

[#log4j-api]
Log4j API::
This is the interface that you use in your application to log events.
It needs to be available at compile-time and no configuration is needed.
By using it, you ensure that your application can write logs but is not tied to a specific logging implementation.

[#log4j-core]
Log4j Core::
The Log4j Core is a logging implementation that processes log events.
It is responsible for filtering, routing, encoding, and appending log events.
This needs to be available at runtime and requires configuration by the user.
When you deploy your application, you must also deploy the Log4j Core or any
other logging implementation along with its configuration to consume all generated log events

The following sections show you examples of how you can get started quickly with Log4j.

[#config-app]
== How do I configure Log4j to run my **application**?

The following section describes, how an application can be configured to use Log4j.
It will add a configuration and some other artifacts to your application.
The configuration shown here enhances the security and usability of your application.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Are you implementing not an **application**, but a **library**?
Please skip to the xref:#config-lib[] instead.
====

As mentioned, Log4j is using a logging API. 
First of all, add the `log4j-core` **runtime** dependency to our application.
Second, it is highly recommended to add the `log4j-layout-template-json` **runtime** dependency to encode log events in JSON.
This is the most secure way to format log events and should preferred over the default `PatternLayout`, at least for production deployments.

  runtimeOnly 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-layout-template-json' // <1>
}
----
====
<1> Note that the logging implementation and bridges are only needed at runtime.

Now it is time to configure Log4j and instruct how the log events should be routed.

The xref:manual/json-template-layout.adoc[JSON Template Layout] is used to encode log events in JSON.
Once encoded xref:manual/appenders.adoc[Appenders] are responsible for writing log events to the console, file, socket, database, etc.

The `<logger>` defines, that log events generated by classes in the `com.mycompany` package (incl. its sub-packages) and that are of level `INFO` and higher (i.e., `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`) will be consumed.
Finally, the `<root>` logger defines that log events of level `WARN` and higher will be consumed unless specified otherwise. It serves as a default configuration.

Save the following XML document to `src/**main**/resources/log4j2.xml`.

.An example `src/**main**/resources/log4j2.xml`

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

If you want to configure Log4j for tests, you are strongly advised to use a different Log4j configuration.
Continue to xref:#config-test[]

[#integrating-log4j]
== Integrating Log4j with SLF4J

In many cases, you might have a library that logs through SLF4J. 
Due to the separation of Log4js API and Core, you can add a bridge to forward SLF4J calls to the Log4j API.
This way, SLF4J calls will be processed by Log4j Core too.

It is similarly easy: just add the new dependency `log4j-slf4j2-impl to your application.

[tabs]

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]

<project>
  <!-- Other dependencies -->

  <dependency>
    <!-- SLF4J-to-Log4j bridge --><!--2-->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>log4j-slf4j2-impl</artifactId>

    </dependency>

  </dependency>

----
dependencies {
  // Other dependencies

  // SLF4J-to-Log4j bridge // <2>
  runtimeOnly 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j2-impl' // <1>

}
----
====
<1> Again, we only need a runtime dependency.
<2> This dependency will forward SLF4J calls to the Log4j API.

`log4j-slf4j2-impl` forwards SLF4J calls to Log4j API, which effectively gets processed by Log4j Core too.

[#config-lib]
== How do I configure Log4j for my **library**?

Unlike applications, libraries should be logging implementation agnostic.
That is, **libraries should log through a logging API, but leave the decision of the logging implementation to the application**.
That said, libraries need a logging implementation while running their tests.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Are you implementing not a **library**, but an **application**?
Please skip to the xref:#config-app[] instead.
====

Add the `log4j-core` dependency in **test** scope to your library. 
Very similar to the previous section, in most cases it is useful to also add the `log4j-slf4j2-impl` dependency. 
SLF4J is a widely used logging API and this way, SLF4J calls will be processed by Log4j Core too.

  // SLF4J-to-Log4j bridge // <2>
  testRuntimeOnly 'org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-slf4j2-impl' // <1>

}
----
====
<1> Note that the logging implementation and bridges are only needed for tests.
<2> `log4j-slf4j2-impl` forwards SLF4J calls to the Log4j API.

Next, you need a `src/**test**/resources/log4j2-test.xml`.
See xref:#config-test[]

[#config-test]
== How do I configure Log4j for tests?

For tests, prefer a human-readable layout with increased verbosity.
While it is not recommended to use the `PatternLayout` in production for security reasons, it is a good choice for tests.

The xref:manual/layouts.adoc#PatternLayout[Pattern Layout] is used for formatting strings in a specific way.
In the below case, it will include the timestamp, thread name, log level, class name, and the message and
print it to the Console.
Very similar to the earlier configuration, the `<logger>` defines what should be logged on
which level and the `<root>` logger serves as a default configuration.

Save the following XML document to `src/**test**/resources/log4j2-test.xml`.

.An example `src/**test**/resources/log4j2-test.xml`
[source,xml]
