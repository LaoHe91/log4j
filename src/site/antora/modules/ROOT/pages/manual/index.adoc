== Welcome to Apache Log4j!

Welcome to Apache Log4j, one of the world's most widely used logging frameworks.

Logging is an essential part of the software development process. 
It provides a way to track the flow of execution in a program, allowing developers 
to understand the application's behavior without needing a debugger. 
This is particularly useful when trying to track down a bug or understand 
why a particular piece of code is running slow.

The original concept for Log4j was conceived in early 1996 when the 
E.U. SEMPER project decided to develop its own tracing API. 
In 2003, the project was donated to the Apache Software Foundation, becoming Apache Log4j. 

Since then, Log4j has seen numerous releases and has become a widely adopted solution.

== When should you use Log4j?

Log4j is an excellent choice for any Java application that needs logging capabilities. 
It is user-friendly, fast, and flexible. You can use it to log messages at 
different levels of severity, from debug to fatal, and you can configure it to 
log messages to various destinations, such as files, databases, or the console.

== When not to use Log4j?

While Log4j is a highly suitable choice for many applications, 
it may be challenging to locate the information you require when 
logging a high volume of messages. 
Additionally, logging can impact your application's performance.

Log4j offers solutions to address these concerns. However, if you are in 
a unique situation where you are concerned about logging overhead or volume, you may wish 
to consider not using logging at all.

== Benefits of Log4j

Log4j offers numerous advantages, including:

1. **Easy to use**: Log4j is easy to use and configure. You can get started
   with just a few lines of code.
2. **Speed**: Log4j is fast and has a low overhead. For more information see: xref:manual/async.adoc[Asynchronous Loggers]
3. **Reliable**: Log4j is reliable and has been used in many production applications.
4. **Audit-ready**: Log4j is designed to be a reliable audit logging framework that 
   does not lose any events, unlike some competing frameworks.
5. **Small footprint**: Log4j has a small impact on the garbage collector. For details, see: xref:manual/garbagefree.adoc[garbage-free].
6. **Extensible**: Log4j is designed to be easily extended using a xref:manual/plugins.adoc[plugin system], 
   allowing users to customize it to xref:manual/extending.adoc[fit their specific needs].
7. **Modern Syntax**: Log4j supports xref:manual/api.adoc#LambdaSupport[lambda expressions]
8. **Integration**: Log4j integrates with numerous other frameworks and libraries.
9. **ASF Standards**: Developed at the Apache Software Foundation, adhering to rigorous standards and best practices.
