[id=log4j.gc.enableDirectEncoders]
== `log4j.gc.enableDirectEncoders`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Env. variable | LOG4J_GC_ENABLE_DIRECT_ENCODERS
| Type          | `boolean`
| Default value | `true`
|===

If `true`, garbage-aware layouts will directly encode log events into https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html[ByteBuffer]s provided by appenders.

This prevents allocating temporary `String` and `char[]` instances.

[id=log4j.gc.encoderByteBufferSize]
== `log4j.gc.encoderByteBufferSize`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Env. variable | LOG4J_GC_ENCODER_BYTE_BUFFER_SIZE
| Type          | `int`
| Default value | `8192`
|===

The size in bytes of the link:../https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html[ByteBuffer]s stored in `ThreadLocal` fields by layouts and link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/layout/StringBuilderEncoder[StringBuilderEncoder]s.

This setting is only used if <<log4j.gc.enableDirectEncoders>> is set to `true`.

[id=log4j.gc.encoderCharBufferSize]
== `log4j.gc.encoderCharBufferSize`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Env. variable | LOG4J_GC_ENCODER_CHAR_BUFFER_SIZE
| Type          | `int`
| Default value | `4096`
|===

The size in ``char``s of the link:../https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html[ByteBuffer]s stored in `ThreadLocal` fields link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/layout/StringBuilderEncoder[StringBuilderEncoder]s.

This setting is only used if <<log4j.gc.enableDirectEncoders>> is set to `true`.

[id=log4j.gc.initialReusableMsgSize]
== `log4j.gc.initialReusableMsgSize`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Env. variable | LOG4J_GC_INITIAL_REUSABLE_MSG_SIZE
| Type          | `int`
| Default value | `128`
|===

In GC-free mode, this property determines the initial size of the reusable ``StringBuilder``s used by link:../javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/ReusableMessage[ReusableMessages] for formatting purposes.

[id=log4j.gc.maxReusableMsgSize]
== `log4j.gc.maxReusableMsgSize`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Env. variable | LOG4J_GC_MAX_REUSABLE_MSG_SIZE
| Type          | `int`
| Default value | `518`
|===

In GC-free mode, this property determines the maximum size of the reusable ``StringBuilder``s used by link:../javadoc/log4j-api/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/ReusableMessage[ReusableMessages] for formatting purposes.

The default value allows is equal to `2 &times; (2 &times; log4j.initialReusableMsgSize + 2) + 2` and allows the
``StringBuilder`` to be resized twice by the current JVM resize algorithm.

[id=log4j.gc.layoutStringBuilderMaxSize]
== `log4j.gc.layoutStringBuilderMaxSize`

[cols="1h,5"]
|===
| Env. variable | LOG4J_GC_LAYOUT_STRING_BUILDER_MAX_SIZE
| Type          | `int`
| Default value | `2048`
|===

This property determines the maximum size of the reusable ``StringBuilder``s used to format link:../javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/LogEvent[LogEvents].
