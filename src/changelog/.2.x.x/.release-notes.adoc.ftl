<#if release.date?has_content>Release date:: ${release.date}</#if>

This minor release contains bug fixes and behavioral improvements.

=== Exception handling in Pattern Layout

Exception handling in Pattern Layout went through a major rewrite.
This effectively helped with fixing some bugs by matching the feature parity of all exception converters.
Additionally, rendered stack traces are ensured to be prefixed with a newline, which used to be a whitespace in earlier versions.
